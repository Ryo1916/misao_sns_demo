# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rails secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

# Shared secrets are available across all environments.

# shared:

# Environmental secrets are only available for that specific environment.


# Do not keep production secrets in the unencrypted secrets file.
# Instead, either read values from the environment.
# Or, use `bin/rails secrets:setup` to configure encrypted secrets
# and move the `production:` environment over there.
